# :notes: XML Orchestra :notes:

See and hear XML with XML Orchestra! The length of each line in the XML data determines the playback rate of the sound.

### Background
The XML data represents a few of the Java objects that were captured and serialized during our experiments with **[pankti](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01198)**, a tool to generate unit tests by monitoring applications as they execute.

### Run
- `git clone git@github.com:Deee92/xml-orchestra.git`
- `cd xml-orchestra/`
- `python3 -m http.server`
- Visit `http://localhost:8000/` to listen
